# Post eval notes

    Don't assume judges know Conway's game of life or boids.

    Know Conway's rules and Boids rules precisely.

    What is significance of Life or what you are doing or Boids?

    What application? How does this relate to real life?

    Could use K factor complexity to measure spacial complexity.

    Demonstrate variety based only on changing parameters. Have screen shots.

    What questions? hypotheses? what can you test with this model?

    Swarm robot applications? Different patterns suited to different situations based only on parameter changes?

    Existential question. Life on Earth. 

    At start of presentation: why? What is the point?

    Measure complexity and entropy over time.

    Measure particular outcomes and then explain how these outcomes change when the parameters are changed.

Tasks

    Finalize metrics so that hypothesis testing is possible. 

    Find extremes of metrics from certain parameter sets, i.e. high clustering from high turn rate

    Entropy of ideal gas, other metric

    Gather paramspace test data

    Ranges for params

    Turn on/off different features
