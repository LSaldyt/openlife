# Evaluation between Feb 3 and Feb 24

Analysis/Network stuff
 - Distance based networks

Debugging
 - Population dynamics/extinction
 
Long Vision, better searching

Parameter tweaks 
 - Social Interaction, Vision

Why does population decline below its initial value? This should never happen.
Logging of cause of death (over/under socialization)

Initial conditions, testing stabilization
Specifically, hardcoded initial conditions (Proof of concept)
Ex: Life's 2x2 square

Unit tests for features once they are fixed

Ex: Two cells not close enough to be neighbors, should move towards one another
