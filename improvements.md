# Improvements

### September

 - Movement  
Fixed speed, continuous turning  
Neighbor rules (introvert, extrovert behavior)  
Loneliness and crowdedness affect movement (center of mass of neighborhood (seek or don't seek))  

 - Spawning  
Reach threshold then spawn  
Spawn at angle to original  
Movement of children different than parents   

 - Dying  
Loneliness - take damage  
Crowdedness - take damage  
  
### October

Measurement of complexity (ie average distance from center of mass)

Time between repition of states
i.e. grid patterns, similar to game of life (Compares more directly)

Draw a network between neighbors (line to closest neighbor)
Count disconnected networks and average network size
In the future, the network might be directed
(Compares to touching cells in life)

Above measurements should allow comparisons to life when possible
 - Density (Draw center of mass)
 - Network Measure (number of disconnected networks, average size of networks)
 - Time until repeated discrete state
